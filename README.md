# Wallstreet-menace
This bot browses WallStreetBets telling you the quality of each posts.
You can input the sub reddit and time fram and the bot should return the answers.
It is very basic and Is most deffinitly not financial advice.
I did test the bot and did trades based off of its A grade tickers. I did get net gain returns acroos all trades however, this was at the peak of the WallstreetBets subreddit.
